## Prompt

Phase 6

## Response snapshot

Phase 6 implementation of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook project was successfully completed, creating the capstone project that integrates all concepts learned across modules, allowing students to demonstrate understanding of the complete humanoid robotics pipeline.

The following tasks were completed:

- T062: Created capstone overview page explaining the full pipeline from voice command to action
- T063: Created 5-1-project-overview.md with text, image, and diagram content
- T064: Created 5-2-voice-command-processing.md with text and code content
- T065: Created 5-3-navigation-obstacle-handling.md with text, code, and diagram content
- T066: Created 5-4-object-recognition-manipulation.md with text, code, and image content
- T067: Created 5-5-final-integration-demonstration.md with text, diagram, image, and code content
- T068: Created and added capstone system architecture diagram to static/img/capstone/
- T069: Created and added final demonstration screenshots to static/img/capstone/
- T070: Added Python integration code examples (≤20 lines each)
- T071: Validated capstone content meets 300-400 word count requirement per subchapter
- T072: Verified capstone integrates concepts from all previous modules
- T073: Tested cross-module navigation and concept references

The implementation successfully demonstrates how to integrate voice command processing, navigation, and object recognition into a working autonomous humanoid system that demonstrates end-to-end functionality from voice input to physical robot action. The capstone project successfully integrates concepts from all four core modules.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Successfully created comprehensive capstone project integrating all concepts
- 🧪 Tests: All content validated for constitution compliance (code length, word counts, formatting)
- 📁 Files: Created 8 new files and updated 1 existing file
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for Phase 7 implementation
- 🧠 Reflection: Implementation followed planned architecture with good educational focus

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - All content meets constitution requirements
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard implementation prompt
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin Phase 7 implementation
