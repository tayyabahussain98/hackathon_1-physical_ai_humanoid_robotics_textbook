# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

Welcome to Module 2 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook. This module focuses on creating and working with digital twins using Gazebo and Unity simulation environments.

## Overview

A digital twin is a virtual representation of a physical robot that allows for testing and development without the risk of damaging hardware. In this module, you'll learn:

- Physics simulation in Gazebo
- High-fidelity rendering in Unity
- Sensor simulation for LiDAR, depth cameras, and IMUs

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Set up and configure Gazebo simulation environments
- Implement realistic physics models for humanoid robots
- Simulate various sensor types and interpret their data
- Use Unity for high-fidelity visualization

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Completed Module 1 (ROS 2 fundamentals)
- Basic understanding of physics concepts
- Familiarity with 3D environments
