# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

Welcome to Module 4 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook. This module covers Vision-Language-Action systems that enable robots to understand natural language commands and execute corresponding physical actions.

## Overview

Vision-Language-Action systems bridge human communication and robot execution. In this module, you'll learn:

- Voice-to-action conversion using OpenAI Whisper
- Cognitive planning to translate language to ROS 2 actions
- Multi-modal interaction combining speech, vision, and gesture

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Process voice commands using speech recognition
- Plan robot actions based on natural language input
- Implement multi-modal interaction systems
- Integrate vision, language, and action components

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Completed Modules 1-3
- Understanding of natural language processing concepts
- Familiarity with action planning systems
