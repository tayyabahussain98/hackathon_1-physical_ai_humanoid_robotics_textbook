# Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)

Welcome to Module 3 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook. This module explores NVIDIA Isaac, a comprehensive platform for developing AI-powered robot brains.

## Overview

The AI-Robot Brain is responsible for perception, planning, and decision-making in humanoid robots. In this module, you'll learn:

- NVIDIA Isaac Sim for photorealistic simulation
- Isaac ROS for VSLAM and navigation
- Nav2 for path planning specifically for bipedal humanoids

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Set up and use NVIDIA Isaac Sim for robot simulation
- Implement Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (VSLAM)
- Configure navigation systems for humanoid robots using Nav2
- Plan paths that account for bipedal locomotion constraints

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Completed Modules 1 and 2
- Understanding of computer vision concepts
- Basic knowledge of path planning algorithms
