# Capstone: The Autonomous Humanoid

Welcome to the Capstone project of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook. This module integrates all concepts learned across the previous modules into a complete autonomous humanoid system.

## Overview

The capstone project brings together all components of the humanoid robotics pipeline:

- Voice command processing from Module 4
- Navigation and obstacle handling from Module 3
- Sensor simulation and perception from Module 2
- ROS 2 communication infrastructure from Module 1

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this capstone project, you will be able to:
- Integrate voice command processing with robot action execution
- Implement comprehensive navigation with obstacle avoidance
- Perform object recognition and manipulation
- Demonstrate end-to-end functionality of an autonomous humanoid

## Prerequisites

Before starting this capstone project, you should have:
- Completed all previous modules (Modules 1-4)
- Understanding of all components in the robotics pipeline
- Ability to troubleshoot integration issues
