# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

Welcome to Module 1 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook. This module introduces you to the Robot Operating System (ROS 2), which serves as the nervous system for humanoid robots.

## Overview

ROS 2 provides the communication infrastructure that allows different components of a humanoid robot to work together. In this module, you'll learn:

- The fundamentals of ROS 2 architecture
- How nodes, topics, and services enable robot communication
- How to bridge Python agents to ROS controllers
- Understanding URDF for humanoid robot design

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Explain the core concepts of ROS 2
- Create and connect ROS 2 nodes
- Implement communication patterns using topics and services
- Understand how URDF describes robot structure

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Basic Python programming knowledge
